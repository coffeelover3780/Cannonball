# Your Live, Shareable Hyperlink

This is the final and most exciting step! You want a link to share your game with the world.

As an AI, I have built the entire application for you, but I cannot perform the action of deploying it to a live internet server.

However, the **`SHARING_GUIDE.md`** file in your project contains the precise, easy-to-follow instructions to do this yourself in about 5-10 minutes using a free service.

### Your Link Will Look Like This:

Once you follow the steps in the guide, you will get a real, public URL. It will be a hyperlink similar to this placeholder:

**`https://your-unique-game-name.netlify.app`**

### Quick Summary of Steps (from `SHARING_GUIDE.md`):

1.  **Push Code:** Upload your project files to a new repository on GitHub.
2.  **Host for Free:** Sign up for a free account on a service like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
3.  **Connect & Deploy:** Connect Netlify to your GitHub repository, add your Gemini API key in the site settings, and click "Deploy".

That's it! You'll have your live link, ready to be pasted into your social media posts. Good luck with the launch!
